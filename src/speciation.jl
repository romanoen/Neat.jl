Compute the compatibility distance between two genomes `g1` and `g2` (similarity between genomes using innovation numbers and weights).
Uses NEAT's distance formula:

    δ = (c1 * E / N) + (c2 * D / N) + (c3 * W)

- E = number of excess genes
- D = number of disjoint genes
- W = average weight difference of matching genes
- N = number of genes in the larger genome (set to 1 if small for stability)

# Keyword Arguments
- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`: importance of each factor

# Returns
- A `Float64` distance value (lower means more similar)

Groups genomes into species based on compatibility.

Assign each genome in the population to a species in `species_list` based on
compatibility distance. A genome is added to the first species where distance
to the representative is below the threshold. If no such species exists, a new
species is created with this genome.

- `species_list`: Vector of species (each a vector of genomes)
- `threshold`: Maximum allowed compatibility distance to join a species

Applies fitness sharing to scale each genome’s fitness relative to its species size.

Modifies each genome's fitness value in-place by applying NEAT-style fitness sharing:
- Divides each genome's fitness by the number of members in its species.

# Arguments
- `species_list`: A vector of species, where each species is a vector of genomes.

- Overwrites each genome's `fitness` value with the adjusted fitness.
