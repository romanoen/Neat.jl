    compatibility_distance(g1::Genome, g2::Genome; c1::Union{Float64,Missing}=missing, c2::Union{Float64,Missing}=missing, c3::Union{Float64,Missing}=missing) -> Float64

Compute the NEAT compatibility distance between two genomes:

    δ = (c1 * E / N) + (c2 * D / N) + (c3 * W)

where
- `E` is the number of excess genes,
- `D` is the number of disjoint genes,
- `W` is the average weight difference of matching genes,
- `N` is the number of genes in the larger genome (treated as 1 if small for stability).

If any of `c1`, `c2`, or `c3` is not defined, its value is loaded from the speciation section of the configuration.

# Arguments
- `g1`, `g2` : The two `Genome` instances to compare.
- `c1` : Coefficient for excess genes.
- `c2` : Coefficient for disjoint genes.
- `c3` : Coefficient for average weight differences.

# Returns
- `Float64` : The compatibility distance (lower means more similar).

Divide a population of genomes into species based on compatibility distance.

For each genome (in random order), compute its distance to the representative of each existing species (the first member). If the smallest distance is ≤ `speciation_threshold`, add it to that species; otherwise, start a new species with this genome as its representative.

If `speciation_threshold`, `c1`, `c2`, or `c3` is `missing`, the corresponding value is loaded from the training parameters in the configuration.

# Arguments
- `population` : Vector of genomes to classify.
- `species_list` : Vector of species (each a vector of genomes) to populate.
- `speciation_threshold` : Maximum compatibility distance to join an existing species.
- `c1`, `c2`, `c3` : Coefficients forwarded to `compatibility_distance`.

# Side Effects
- Clears and reassigns `species_list` in-place.

Applies fitness sharing to scale each genome’s fitness relative to its species size.
